# 🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning
A machine learning project that predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on environmental and soil conditions. This system helps farmers make data-driven decisions and promotes sustainable agriculture.

# 📌 Project Overview
Agriculture is a critical sector, and choosing the right crop can significantly impact yield and profitability. This project uses a supervised learning model to recommend crops based on factors like:
Nitrogen (N)
Phosphorus (P)
Potassium (K)
Temperature
Humidity
pH value
Rainfall

# 🧠 Technologies Used
Language: Python
IDE: Jupyter Notebook
Libraries:
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# 🔍 Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Crop Recommendation Dataset
Samples: ~2200
Features: N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall
Target: Crop name (e.g., rice, maize, cotton, lentil, etc.)

# ⚙️ Model and Approach
Model Used: Random Forest Classifier
Steps:
Data preprocessing & exploration
Feature analysis
Model training and evaluation
Performance comparison with other ML algorithms
Final Accuracy: 98%

# 📈 Results
High accuracy with minimal misclassifications
Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree
Feature importance graph shows Nitrogen, pH, and rainfall as top contributors
